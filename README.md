# Iris Flower Classifier

This project is a web-based application designed to classify iris flower species using a machine learning model integrated with the Django web framework. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input iris flower measurements and receive real-time predictions of the species.

### Key Features

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive forms for users to input iris flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
Real-Time Predictions: Instantly predicts the species of the iris flower based on the input measurements.
Accurate Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for high accuracy in classification.
Django Backend: Employs the Django framework to manage backend processes, ensuring a robust and scalable application.

### Technical Overview

Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an easy-to-use input form for iris measurements.
Backend: Django framework handles user inputs, processes data, and communicates with the machine learning model.
Machine Learning: The classification model is trained on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, to deliver reliable species predictions.

This project exemplifies the integration of machine learning with web development, offering a practical and educational example of deploying a machine learning model in a web application. It is ideal for those interested in exploring the intersection of web development and machine learnin
